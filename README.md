# Readout_Simulation
Simulation tool for different readout architectures of Particle Detectors
The structure of the program is outlined in Auslese-Simulation.mm (A Freeplane mind map)

The simulation aims at synchronous detector architectures. For asynchronous detectors refer to Enrico Junior Schioppa's implementation developed for the MALTA sensor.
